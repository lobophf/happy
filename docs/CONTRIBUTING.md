## What should I know before I get started?
Happy is an application that connects people to orphanages and so to make children's day happier.

## How Can I Contribute?
### Reporting bugs
If you run into an error or bug with the project:
* Open an issue at https://github.com/lobophf/happy/issues
* Include reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
* Provide details like operating system and compiler versions.

### Developing happy
Well, this application was developed only for training in a Bootcamp. So I have no plans to add new features and would 
like to keep it untouched. But you can fork it and make improvements by yourself. However, if you want to contribute by 
fixing bugs or types mistakes, create a side branch and open a pull request.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
To write commits messages, it would be nice if you used the template available in this repository. You can easily configure it using the command below:
```
$ git config --local commit.template docs/.git-commit-template.txt
```
So, when you create a commit, don't use the "-m" or "--message" option. Just type the command below and wait for your editor to open. The template file contains other instructions. When you finished, save and close the file.
```
$ git commit
```
